# Hello there!

I'm Maxim, also known as Miatr or Crispy, you can choose.  
The former is for most of my online presence, the latter is my instagram photography account alias.

I study Multimedia & Creative Technologies at Erasmushogeschool Brussel, currently in my last year.  
My skills are full-stack development, with a focus on front-end.  
I also make music once in a while, and I have a photography account @crispy.drinks on instagram.  

I hope you like the projects you see here!
